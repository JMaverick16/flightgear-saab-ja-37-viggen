------------------
Rendering options: Particles, precipitation, 3D clouds: On. Model-shader: top setting

Detailed weather: On
Detailed weather, Advanced settings: wind-model:Generate aloft-waypoints, Terrain presampling, Realistic visibility. (it's an all-weather fighter, it can handle it)
Cockpit view options: Disable headmovement due to g-force. Redout/blackout is enabled by default when MP discharge is ON and cannot then be disabled.


Compatibility with Flightgear 2.8
---------------------------------
There is now a separate download in the hangar for FG 2.8


Notes
---------
The aircraft is sorta Rembrandt ready, no glaring issues. ALS is recommended though.
Be mindful of failure messages in the TI display FAIL menu, if a gear locking mechanism fails due to being deployed at too high speed, that gear will not be able to support the weight of the aircraft till you repair it from the menu.
