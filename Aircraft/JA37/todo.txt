Aero: Make cannon ammo have pointweight.
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)

Model: Make the tooltips fail when gauges fail.
Model: The reserve generator. (ram air turbine)
Model: Proper floor in the cockpit.
Model: Fix z-fighting on HUD brightness-knob, M71-rail and M90. (strange, might not be z-fighting, but sure looks like it)
Model: A/P control in cockpit: A/T on throttle, A/P disengage on stick.

Sim: To disengage A/P to mode 0 press switch on stick or pull fuse (will also disengage A/T).
Sim: OPT FIX button pressed will make the current destination selected moved to right under the aircraft at push time. (datapanel rensa will set it back to what was programmed)
Sim: Select L on systems panel to select preprogrammed landing base. LB then for long approach, LF for short.
Sim: Pitot depend on AC power.
Sim: Some systems should get DC power directly from batt., some only when main power switch is on. Check diagram.
Sim: The A/P for glideslope is not very reliable, fix.
Sim: Fix that when changing airport location, battery gets drained, and therefore gives master warning for a while after startup.

HUD: Alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight. (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.
HUD: When DME are enabled at the same time as ILS with glideslope, the distance scale make the ILS view confusing.
HUD: Make crossing out of hud when armament not ready to fire and trigger is pressed.
HUD: Enable Richards new wrapper, to improve terrain warning. (2018.1.1)

Bugs:
--------------
Control: {Pinto} Pitch damper does fast violent oscillations at 36000ft M2.25+ without droptank.
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
HUD: When the altitude difference to a track is much larger than the horizontal distance, the track positions are off.
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Model: AJ Droptank indicator should really be a steerpoint indicator.
Model: In FG 2.12 radar screen does not work as it should. (no canvas replacement)
Model: All shader use of <use> does not work over MP.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: If HoT (/sim/multiplay/hot) is enabled, geo reports wrong ground elevation at a AI/MP aircraft location.
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout. [was bug in jsbsim, fixed in 2016.1]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sim: {Pinto} After fire M70, and reload, they will fire again. [might be fixed]
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Effect: Firing many M70 rockets in quick succession will make FG crash. [Probably fixed]
Sim: A/T at high alpha does not work for Pinto, too high alpha. (3k ft, 30% fuel, no reverse)



Issues with FG:
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.
