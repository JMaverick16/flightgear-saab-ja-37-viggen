TODO for Flightgear Saab 37 Viggen
==================================


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
GUI: Improve Checklists.
GUI: Option to switch off hitting stuff above ground. (switched off now, might confuse users)
Aero: Make recoil not assume that FDM rate is 120 Hz.
Aero: Tune speedbrake better.
Aero: Remove speedbrake in JA and AJS. Only AJ should have it.
Aero: Make cannon ammo have pointweight.
Aero: Adjust wave drag so max speed is M1.85 in ISA atmosphere and M2.03 in ISA-15.
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)
Control: Make bigger factor in pitch normal comparison. (beware of oscillations)
Control: Limit elevator deflection due to servo-moment being smaller than moment of air-pressure. Page 19-20 in AK III.
Model: JA version of nav. panel.
Model: Transponder panel more like the real, right panel.
Model: Make stick from throttle to gears handle housing. The throttle is too wide and the sidepanel is not aligned with X axis, that prevents it.

Model: Make the tooltips fail when gauges fail.
Model: Proper floor in the cockpit.
Model: Fix z-fighting on HUD brightness-knob, M71-rail and M90. (strange, might not be z-fighting, but sure looks like it)
Model: A/P control in cockpit: A/T on throttle, A/P disengage on stick.
Model: Stores jettisoned indicator on top right of front panel?
Model: Switch ALT CISI, altitude source. (Only in AJ variants)
Animation: Review all indicator lights. For example the A/T light should blink by malfunctions or disengagements.

Sim: Make data-link between Viggens.
Sim: Replace MP hit and fire messages with something else, so can leave civilian traffic in peace.
Sim: Implement maximum speed reactions - Vne.
Sim: Engine fire improvement: reduced thrust, stuck throttle.
Sim: Stop auto-selecting when in tactical mode. (semi-done)
Sim: Make speed, roll, Nz and altitude limits on firing missiles.
Sim: Find the exact spot the center M70 fires from (submodels).
Sim: A/P does auto trim of roll.
Sim: Review A/P working property use. Also in jsb for stick control.
Sim: Make schedule for max climb rate with A/P at slow speed different when gears is down (or A/T AoA hold).
Sim: Review all replay signals.
Sim: Only send properties over MP when they change, will save up property space.
Sim: Make data and nav panel functional.
Sim: After exiting transonic the altitude hold is recomputed. 
Sim: To disengage A/P to mode 0 press switch on stick or pull fuse (will also disengage A/T).
Sim: OPT FIX button pressed will make the current destination selected moved to right under the aircraft at push time. (datapanel rensa will set it back to what was programmed)
Sim: Select L on systems panel to select preprogrammed landing base. LB then for long approach, LF for short.
Sim: Pitot depend on AC power.
Sim: Some systems should get DC power directly from batt., some only when main power switch is on. Check diagram.
Sim: The A/P for glideslope is not very reliable, fix.
Sim: Fix that when changing airport location, battery gets drained, and therefore gives master warning for a while after startup.
Sim: Make so that flares cannot be used after aircraft has crashed.
Sim: Check terrain warning for when gears is down/landing mode in manual. (its now set to gears down detect)
Sim: Using data panel an extra bingo fuel warning can be added. % above standard warning is entered. Landing clears it, so does pressing master warning silence.

Sound: Adjust the volume of the explosion of nearby missile, depending on distance.
Sound: Rework how missile buzz and growl works.
Sound: Sound from wind hitting the gears when extended.
Radar: Make rb71 notchable again, by introducing 3 diff painted properties instead of one.

HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.
HUD: When DME are enabled at the same time as ILS with glideslope, the distance scale make the ILS view confusing.
HUD: Make crossing out of hud when armament not ready to fire and trigger is pressed.
HUD: Slave-SI centers the landing guide. And hides the attitude ind. ILS needles. (only AJ variants)
HUD: Altitude scale should only be shown when engine is running due to it need AC power. (pitot-static needs AC?)

DAP: Make 1 more digit in data panel, when inputting longitude.
Animation: Make more use of knob animation: Radio, HUD brightness, Altimeters.
Sim: AC should just blow air, not keep temperature.











List of un-authentic systems, most scheduled for removal/change at some point
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A/P auto-follow never existed. RR steer order, was probably just heading and altitude bugs.
Automatic landing mode selection in AJ was really selected manual like in the JA.
Speedbrake on JA-37Di and AJS-37 were welded shut. Was only working on AJ-37 of these variants.
Callsign of selected radar echo in HUD is unrealistic.
Distance to selected radar echo was next to distance scale where ammo is now, not next to the echo. (was ammo count even in HUD?) If lineis there, the number is line length.
Electronic map should not work, before inertial navigation has finished initializing, or GPS is on.
Interoperability and display switches on frontpanel, should not be there. Instead there was: button SNABBRESN (reinit gyro, max 3 mins, light on during).
The FPI in HUD was really limited to +- 7.5 degs lateral.
In the orig plane the HUD decimal delimiter is ',' not '.'.
VOR, ADF navigation, the real did not have this.
Carrier operations. Use keys Shift-L (hold for 10 seconds), Shift-C and L. Only work on carriers.
Aerobatic smoke.
HUD: Upper half square should really be radar selection.
HUD: Upper semi circle should really be radar lock.
HUD: Lower semi circle should really be IR lock.
TI: Delete, append or insert steerpoint should really be controlled from radar stick.
TI: OPT should really be a button on the flightstick.

Bugs:
--------------
Control: {Pinto} Pitch damper does fast violent oscillations at 36000ft M2.25+ without droptank.
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
HUD: When the altitude difference to a track is much larger than the horizontal distance, the track positions are off.
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Model: AJ Droptank indicator should really be a steerpoint indicator.
Model: In FG 2.12 radar screen does not work as it should. (no canvas replacement)
Model: All shader use of <use> does not work over MP.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: If HoT (/sim/multiplay/hot) is enabled, geo reports wrong ground elevation at a AI/MP aircraft location.
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout. [was bug in jsbsim, fixed in 2016.1]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sim: {Pinto} After fire M70, and reload, they will fire again. [might be fixed]
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Effect: Firing many M70 rockets in quick succession will make FG crash. [Probably fixed]
Sim: A/T at high alpha does not work for Pinto, too high alpha. (3k ft, 30% fuel, no reverse)



Issues with FG:
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.
