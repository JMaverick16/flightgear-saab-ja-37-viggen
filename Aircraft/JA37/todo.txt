TODO for Flightgear Saab 37 Viggen
==================================


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
GUI: Option to turn off verbose popups.
GUI: Improve Checklists.
GUI: Option to switch off hitting stuff above ground. (switched off now, might confuse users)
Aero: Make recoil not assume that FDM rate is 120 Hz.
Aero: Tune speedbrake better.
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)
Model: Make minimal polygon model for multiplayer LOD.
Model: Make liveries that is not 59, able to not have to use base texture.
Model: Ext. power truck more mil style textures.
Model: Put in more working instruments and controls.
Model: Put in not-working instruments and controls for immersion.
Model: Some control textures should be aligned so they can be better viewed from current pilot point of view.
Model: Fix that landing gear oleo struts now are too bright.
Model: Radar range control should be only 3 digits. (and be another place in the cockpit if should be accurate)
Model: Make the tooltips fail when gauge fail.
Model: The reserve generator. (ram air turbine)
Model: Proper floor in the cockpit.
Model: Fix z-fighting on HUD brightness-knob, M71-rail and M90. (strange, might not be z-fighting, but sure looks like it)
Model: A/P control in cockpit: A/T on throttle, A/P disengage on stick.
Model: Review all indicator lights. For example the A/T light should blink by malfunctions or disengagements.
Model: Model speedbrakes.
Model: Fuze panel.
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors and gear retraction.
Animation: Make rear boogie rotate at takeoff/landing rotation.
Animation: Make jettison drop tank actually fall down.
Sim: Improve autopilot further.
Sim: Make autopilot depend fully on instrument properties not true properties. (95% done)
Sim: Implement ejection seat. (with parachute?)
Sim: Reset controls after A/P let go of them.
Sim: Stop using integers in xml where floating point is expected? (is silly, not needed, rely on typecasting instead)
Sim: Make verbose property to be used in all nasal scripts. (possible include in options)
Sim: Make replay show the guided missiles flying.
Sim: Improve terrain warning system.
Sim: Replace all generic setValue in nasal with specific types.
Sim: Make droptank do collision detection. (use retractable)
Sim: Missiles should lock onto flares from other mil plane types.
Sim: Lock warning when another plane get radar lock. (ja37, m2000-5, f-14b, f-15)
Sim: Complete hydraulic dependencies: Brakes.
Sim: Hydraulic drain.
Sim: Shift-m should be a key without shift instead for convenience.
Sim: Specific damage to gears in crash code, speed of impact and vertical speed separate. (terrain type?)
Sim: Make the weapon mode dial operational: simulated mode, operational mode and reduced mode.
Sim: Make data-link between Viggens.
Sim: Replace MP hit and fire messages with something else, so can leave civilian traffic in peace.
Sim: Implement maximum speed reactions - Vne.
Sim: Implement navigation controls into the cockpit.
Sim: Engine fire: reduced thrust, stuck throttle.
Sim: Make missile code generic to be used on helis also.
Sim: Include Shinobis missile changes into missile code. (heat)
Sim: Stop auto-selecting when in tactical mode.
Sim: RB99 will be rail launched if sitting on a rail instead of always dropped.
Sim: Be able to notch the rb71 again.
Sim: Make speed, roll, Nz and altitude limits on firing missiles.
Sim: Find the exact spot the center M70 fires from (submodels).
Sim: A/P does auto trim of roll.
Sim: Review A/P working property use. Also in jsb for stick control.
Sim: Make weapons hit all nearby targets.
Sim: Make m71 bombs not require a target.
Sim: When inverted for more than 10 secs, let oil pressure be affected, and disrupt engine operations.
Sim: Make schedule for max climb rate with A/P at slow speed different when gears is down (or A/T AoA hold).
Sim: Review all replay signals.
Sim: Only send properties over MP when they change, will save up property space.
Sim: Set 4 M71 to fire in ripple at each trigger press.
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone.
Effect: Make pilot G-loc/die due to G-forces.
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes.
Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds. (transonic)
Sound: Make sounds when taking damage in bombable.
Sound: Adjust the volume of the explosion of nearby missile, depending on distance.
Sound: Rework how missile buzz and growl works.
Radar: Make database of RCS of common aircrafts.
Radar: When ILS and DME is tuned to airport, show it on radar with a 20km centerline?
HUD: Make boxes for desired pitch.
HUD: Alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight. (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.
HUD: When DME are enabled at the same time as ILS with glideslope, the distance scale make the ILS view confusing.
HUD: Make crossing out of hud when armament not ready to fire and trigger is pressed.
HUD: Make use of Richards new wrapper, to improve terrain warning. (2017.1.1)



Bugs:
--------------
Control: {Pinto} Pitch damper does fast violent oscillations at 36000ft M2.25+ without droptank.
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
HUD: When the altitude difference to a track is much larger than the horizontal distance, the track positions are off.
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Model: Droptank indicator should really be a steerpoint indicator.
Model: In FG 2.12 radar screen does not work as it should. (no canvas replacement)
Model: All shader use of <use> does not work over MP.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: If HoT (/sim/multiplay/hot) is enabled, geo reports wrong ground elevation at a AI/MP aircraft location.
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout. [was bug in jsbsim, fixed in 2016.1]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sim: {Pinto} After fire M70, and reload, they will fire again. [might be fixed]
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Effect: Firing many M70 rockets in quick succession will make FG crash. [Probably fixed]


Issues with FG:
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.


Compatible version with FG 2.6 (on hold, as it crashes when loading ja37)
------------------------------
