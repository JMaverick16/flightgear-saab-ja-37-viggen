Aero: Make cannon ammo have pointweight.
Aero: Make recoil not assume that FDM rate is 120 Hz.
Aero: Remove speedbrake in JA and AJS. Only AJ should have it. Welded shut in the others.
Aero: Tune speedbrake better.
Animation: Main attitude indicator lazy and jumps from 180 to -180.
Animation: Make jettison drop-tank actually fall down like other stores do.
Animation: Make rear boogie rotate at takeoff/landing rotation.
Animation: Review all indicator lights. For example the A/T light should blink by malfunctions or disengagements.
Animation: The bypass handle should not stay up for long.
Arms: Auto LOAL RB99. Lock on after launch.
Arms: Be able to notch the rb71 again.
Arms: Home on jam for missiles.
Arms: IR lock before launch should also check terrain occlusion.

Arms: Narrow scan pattern for dogfighting. (narrow yaw, mid to high pitch.)
Arms: Pickle delay.
Arms: RB99 will be rail launched if sitting on a rail instead of always dropped.
Arms: Set 4 M71 to fire in ripple at each trigger press.
Arms: Should seeker position be shown in MI and HUD for non IR? (lean towards no)
Arms: The auto pattern scan should not jump from bottom to top.

CI: Memory button, for freezing image.
CI: Slew cursor.
Control: A/P does auto trim of roll.
Control: After exiting transonic the altitude hold should be recomputed. 
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)

Control: Make bigger factor in pitch normal comparison. (beware of oscillations)
Control: overhaul rudder trim.
DAP: Can enter K time (attack-time) for steerpoints. When that is done, it also becomes target steerpoint?

DAP: In pos/out showing info on next steerpoint, for steerpoints greater than 09, show hex. 11-15 = landing bases.
DAP: Input TACAN with REG/STR?
DAP: Minneslista JA37 has some DAP addresses. Make.
DAP: Output of not defined addresses should just be 0000?
DAP: Possible to enter date and revision number of LV/FF 001-189. But how?
DAP: Show sign of input at leftmost char always.
DAP: With L selector in LDL (auto-mode) L1 is asumed to be start base and L2 landing base. Hmm, need to know more..
Doc: Thorsten Renk suggested to make a PDF manual. ETA. before 2020.
Effect: Ambient occlusion map need to be baked again, many parts are too occluded.
Effect: Fix that with engine off, the wind can drive the fan which will produce smoke.

HUD: Do not show rb99 seeker diamond. (not sure if I haven't fixed)
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.
HUD: In OPT mode, the sink rate is only at low altitudes, before that its 1:20.
HUD: Make crossing out of hud when armament not ready to fire and trigger is pressed.
HUD: Radar alt in alt scale, can move outside clip bounds. fix?
HUD: Slave-SI centers the landing guide. And hides the attitude ind. ILS needles. (only AJ variants)

Sim: Complete hydraulic dependencies: Brakes.
Sim: Engine fire improvement: reduced thrust, stuck throttle.
Sim: Find the exact spot the center M70 fires from (submodels).

Sim: Review A/P working property use. Also in jsb for stick control.
Sim: Review all replay signals.
Sim: Shift-m should be a key without shift instead for convenience.
Sim: Specific damage to gears in crash code, speed of impact and vertical speed separate. (terrain type?)
Sim: Startup with engines on, should have inertial navigation ready. (maybe altimeter should be preset too)
Sim: Stop auto-selecting when in tactical mode. (semi-done)
Sim: Strange slowdown of FPS after flying for a while and fighting with aim9.
Sim: To disengage A/P to mode 0 press switch on stick or pull fuse (will also disengage A/T).
Sound: Adjust the volume of the explosion of nearby missile, depending on distance.
Sound: I think I broke the AJ stall warn switch, fix.
Sound: Knobs for pylon and master-arm has no sound, fix.
Sound: Replace the "incoming" annunciator warnings with radar lock radio noise. (not sure it worked like that, seems Apparat63 had 2 tones, hmm)

Test: Testing from TI.
TI: Add rb-99 to SVY?
TI: Auto switching to next steerpoint happens when less than 3Km from current, and distance increasing.
TI: Be able to set steerorder to LV or FF points. (I cannot see in manual where that should be possible, so is on hold)
TI: Convert moving map to MapStructure. Slippy, airports, grid, traffic, FF, LV, routes, areas, runway, landingCircle/Line, missiles, bullseye, AAA.
TI: Has almost 100 getprop calls, convert to getValue.
TI: In menu SYST place cursor over steerpoint to see ETA (passagetid?). Most likely time planned to pass.
TI: In menu SYST, button 'LB'/'LS'. Steer order first to tangent point.
TI: In menu WEAP between the two middle edge buttons at bottom, its should say AK 120. For 120 ammo left.
TI: Make long route legs be curved.
TI: Make radar limit on SVY. (first radar should be changed to scan and beam be more vertically narrow)
TI: Make route info with overall ETA.
TI: Menu CONF-READDATA should show a static page.
TI: MPOL should only be able to hold 24 legs, and RPOL only 8. 48 + B0 + BDL in total.

TI: MSDA menu should only show polygon legs for the primary plan. (but still steerpoints for all)
TI: Navigation mode RR probably was intercept vector.
TI: Prioritize showing only 10 FF/LV points.
TI: RB99 telemetry should show IDLE, SCAN or LOCK when not fired.
TI: Run different through plans when drawing them on canvas. (what did I mean by this?)
TI: Select self and then show in lower right corner infobox on own flight.
TI: Some steerpoint can be forceringsbrytpunkt. Whatever that means.
TI: Steerpoint B0 is start pos. Its shown as current till take-off. When route is started being flown it is set at current position. Should not be saved with plans. Confusing, must know more.
TI: The runway approach line, for some reason do not get updated fast, so when turning sharply, it disconnects from approach circle.(or more likely opposite)
TI: Waypoint info should show ETA to next waypoint. And seperate infobox for full ETA.
TI: When cursor not active on TI, a shadow cursor is shown following the target cursor.
TI: When display is not showing image, backup menu is in effect, with hard-coded functions for the buttons.
TI: When flying RTB or MISS routes and small field in lower right corner should show deltatime, altitude and recommended mach. Whats delta time?
TI: When inertial navigation is not ready and GPS is off, don't show moving map?
Arms: Missiles have a time deficiency when time is slowed down more than 1/4. The JSB slowdown might not be accurate.









List of un-authentic systems, most scheduled for removal/change at some point
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatic landing mode selection in AJ was really selected manual like in the JA.
Speedbrake on JA-37Di and AJS-37 were welded shut. Was only working on AJ-37 of these variants.
Distance to selected radar echo was next to distance scale where ammo is now, not next to the echo. (was ammo count even in HUD?) If line is there, the number is line length.
Electronic map should not work, before inertial navigation has finished initializing, or GPS is on.
The FPI in HUD was really limited to +- 7.5 degs lateral.
In the orig plane the HUD/TI/MI decimal delimiter is ',' not '.'.
VOR, ADF radio navigation, the real did not have this.
Aerobatic smoke, the real probably didn't have.
TI: Append or insert steerpoint should really be controlled from R1 switch, not be part of TI menu.
TI: OPT should really be a button on the flightstick, not be part of TI menu.
The real Viggen displays had 2 cursors; lock-cursor and TIM-cursor. The flightgear Viggen has combined it into 1 cursor.




Bugs:
--------------
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
Model: AJ Droptank indicator should really be a steerpoint indicator.
Model: All shader use of <use> does not work over MP.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: If HoT (/sim/multiplay/hot) is enabled, geo reports wrong ground elevation at a AI/MP aircraft location.
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout. [was bug in jsbsim, semi-fixed in 2016.1]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sim: {Pinto} After fire M70, and reload, they will fire again. [might be fixed]
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Effect: Firing many M70 rockets in quick succession will make FG crash. [Probably fixed]
Sim: A/T at high alpha does not work for Pinto, too high alpha. (3k ft, 30% fuel, no reverse)



Issues with FG:
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.


Compatible version with FG 2.6 (on hold, as it crashes when loading ja37)

Less polygons
Less particle effects
