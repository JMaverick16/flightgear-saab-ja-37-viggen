TODO for Flightgear Saab 37 Viggen
==================================


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
Aero: Make recoil not assume that FDM rate is 120 Hz.
Aero: Tune speedbrake better.
Aero: Remove speedbrake in JA and AJS. Only AJ should have it. Welded shut in the others.
Aero: Make cannon ammo have pointweight.
Aero: Adjust wave drag so max speed is M1.85 in ISA atmosphere and M2.03 in ISA-15.
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)
Control: Make bigger factor in pitch normal comparison. (beware of oscillations)
Control: Limit elevator deflection due to servo-moment being smaller than moment of air-pressure. Page 19-20 in AK III.
Control: overhaul rudder trim.
Model: Transponder panel more like the real, right panel.
Model: Make stick from throttle to gears handle housing. The throttle is too wide and the sidepanel is not aligned with X axis, that prevents it.
Model: Improve texturing of gears handle housing, it had some details on it.
Model: JA version of radar control stick.
Model: Airspeed indicator should have mach number also.
Model: The KURS gauge in the JA was more complex. (some kind of ADI)

Model: Make the tooltips fail when gauges fail.
Model: Proper floor in the cockpit.
Model: Fix z-fighting on HUD brightness-knob, datapanel knob, M71-rail and M90. (strange, might not be z-fighting, but sure looks like it)
Model: A/P control in cockpit: A/T on throttle, A/P disengage on stick.
Model: Stores jettisoned indicator on top right of front panel. (AJ)
Model: Switch ALT CISI, altitude source. (Only in AJ variants)
Model: In JA the 2 gauges on right panel sat in a panel.
Model: The A/P pushbuttons light can still be hard to see.

DAP: Input TACAN with REG/STR?
DAP: Minneslista JA37 has some DAP addresses. Make.
DAP: Show sign of input at leftmost char always.
DAP: When saving FF,LV,BE and L. Maybe consider saving alot of other addresses/settings also?
Doc: Thorsten Renk suggested to make a PDF manual. ETA. before 2020.
Effect: Ambient occlusion map need to be baked again, many parts are too occluded.
Effect: Fix that with engine off, the wind can drive the fan which will produce smoke.

GUI: Improve Checklists. Use <group> for grouping them.
HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Altitude scale should only be shown when engine is running due to it need AC power. (pitot-static needs AC?)
HUD: Do not show rb99 seeker diamond. (not sure if I haven't fixed)
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.
HUD: In OPT mode, the sink rate is only at low altitudes, before that its 1:20.

TI: Some steerpoint can be forceringsbrytpunkt. Whatever that means.
HUD/TI: FPI fin touches circle when estimated that will arrive at steerpoint in correct time.

List of un-authentic systems, most scheduled for removal/change at some point
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatic landing mode selection in AJ was really selected manual like in the JA.
Speedbrake on JA-37Di and AJS-37 were welded shut. Was only working on AJ-37 of these variants.
Distance to selected radar echo was next to distance scale where ammo is now, not next to the echo. (was ammo count even in HUD?) If line is there, the number is line length.
Electronic map should not work, before inertial navigation has finished initializing, or GPS is on.
The FPI in HUD was really limited to +- 7.5 degs lateral.
In the orig plane the HUD/TI/MI decimal delimiter is ',' not '.'.
VOR, ADF radio navigation, the real did not have this.
Aerobatic smoke, the real probably didn't have.
TI: Append or insert steerpoint should really be controlled from R1 switch, not be part of TI menu.
TI: OPT should really be a button on the flightstick, not be part of TI menu.
In the real nav. panel you could select STRIL supplied base.
The real Viggen displays had 2 cursors; lock-cursor and TIM-cursor. The flightgear Viggen has combined it into 1 cursor.
GPS fix was used to correct the INS, not to put a point on the TI.



Bugs:
--------------
Control: {Pinto} Pitch damper does fast violent oscillations at 36000ft M2.25+ without droptank.
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
HUD: When autostarting is in progress, the HUD will switch off for a fraction of a second sometimes when loading stores. (due to stores mass moving the aircraft a bit and external power then gets disconnected.).
HUD: When the altitude difference to a track is much larger than the horizontal distance, the track positions are off.
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Model: AJ Droptank indicator should really be a steerpoint indicator.
Model: In FG 2.12 radar screen does not work as it should. (no canvas replacement)
Model: All shader use of <use> does not work over MP.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: If HoT (/sim/multiplay/hot) is enabled, geo reports wrong ground elevation at a AI/MP aircraft location.
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout. [was bug in jsbsim, fixed in 2016.1]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sim: {Pinto} After fire M70, and reload, they will fire again. [might be fixed]
Sim: {Pinto} Has experienced that 2 engine directories were created under engines. That leads to error in performance monitor.
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Effect: Firing many M70 rockets in quick succession will make FG crash. [Probably fixed]
Sim: A/T at high alpha does not work for Pinto, too high alpha. (3k ft, 30% fuel, no reverse)



Issues with FG:
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.


Compatible version with FG 2.6 (on hold, as it crashes when loading ja37)
